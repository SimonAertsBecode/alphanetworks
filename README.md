# Alphanetworks Project

Welcome on the README of Alphanetworks project.

Stack and pattern that have been used are:

> Typescript.
>
> React.
>
> Scss.
>
> Stateful and Stateless components.

While doing this project, the concept of reuse and basic principles such as DRY were always part of my thought process, as if it was going to be part of a much larger application. This may explain why some of the components may seem a bit "overloaded" for a small project like this.
